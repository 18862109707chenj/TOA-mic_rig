Time Of Arrival (TOA) Based Self-Calibration of Dual Microphe Array
==

It focusing on TOA (time-of-arrival)
based self-calibration problem of dual microphone array for
known and unknown rack distance, and also for different
combinations of dimension for the affine spaces spanned by
the receivers and by the senders.

The code is based on the journal paper
"TOA Based Self-Calibration of Dual Microphone Array" 
by Simayijiang Zhayida, Simon Burgess, Yubin Kuang, and Kalle Åström.

All code and data can be used free of charge for academic research, provided that you cite the mentioned paper.
